# Product-Landing-Page

### Description
In this project, I have created a responsive Product Landing Page for some kind of thrifty business. This project was a project I completed in the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design course, of which I am certified. I have added some extra functionality to the web page...<br><br>

But! There is a bug with the navigation! When the screen width <code><= 600</code>, you have to click twice for it to work? Resizing the screen from there, the navigation disappears.
